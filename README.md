Simple Fabric mod for dynamically reloading macros in a specific directory.
Also Includes supporting framework to structure macros.

TO-DO:
- Change it so it doesn't load and store every macro to memory, just the running one. 
    Need to itterate over all of them initially to form the selectable list but don't need to store them.
